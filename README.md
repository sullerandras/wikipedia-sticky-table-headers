Wikipedia sticky table headers
==============================

Displays the table headers on the top of the screen while otherwise the table header would not be visible. So that I know what I'm looking at.
Useful for really tall tables with many columns.

Features
--------

*   supports all tables with or without <thead> element
*   resizes the table headers when resizing the browser window
*   only floats headers of tables which are taller than the screen height (does not recalculate this when resizing the browser window)
